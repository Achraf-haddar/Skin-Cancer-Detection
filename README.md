# Skin Cancer Detection
## Overview:
Skin cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer. Melanoma, specifically, is responsible for 75% of skin cancer deaths, despite being the least common skin cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates over 100,000 new melanoma cases will be diagnosed in 2020. It's also expected that almost 7,000 people will die from the disease. As with other cancers, early and accurate detection—potentially aided by data science—can make treatment more effective.
In the United States, 5 million new cases of skin cancer are diagnosed every year. Of these, melanoma which is the deadliest accounts for over 9000. The diagnosis via visual inspection by patients and dermatologists is accurate only about 60% of the time. Moreover, the shortage of dermatologists per capita has abetted the need for computer-aided methods to detect skin cancer.
In this project, I used pytorch to build a CNN classification model to identify melanoma in images of skin lesions. In particular, I used images within the same patient and determine which are likely to represent a melanoma.

Melanoma is a deadly disease, but if caught early, most melanomas can be cured with minor surgery. Image analysis tools that automate the diagnosis of melanoma will improve dermatologists' diagnostic accuracy. Better detection of melanoma has the opportunity to positively impact millions of people.
